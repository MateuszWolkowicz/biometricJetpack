## Task description :

Android Technical Test Task
As we discussed, following the technical challenge. Please deliver a working app with the code that can:
1. User logs in into application using Email and Password and for later logins, user can use biometrics.
2. The user retrieves an endless list of popular Github repositories with paging.
3. The user can see repository details on the separate screen.
4. Encrypt all data with biometric and store in SQLite DB.
5. Implement offline mode in the application.
6. Detect application biometric changes, inform the user about it, clear all user data and log him out.
7. Every 10 minutes inform(e.g. notification) the user to update the stored data.
8. All UI must be smooth in usage. Animated screen transitions(e.g. shared element).
Review it and let me know when it can be ready. Whilst ui must be smooth, there is no need to focus on design at all.
